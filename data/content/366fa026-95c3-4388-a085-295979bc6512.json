the man for the movement.\nWhile <b>we<\/b> do need to reckon with what <b>Trump <b>himself<\/b><\/b> means for U.S. politics, <b>we<\/b> need to reckon even more urgently with what can now be called the \"Trumpists,\" <b>a solidly right-wing ethno-nationalist voting bloc that has been growing since the mid-1990s<\/b>.\nWhat points to this story?\nThe numbers capturing the ebb and flow in the belief that Barack Obama is a <b>Muslim<\/b> and the crisis over the president's birth certificate.\n<b>Those<\/b> are the ones to watch.\nDuring most of 2008, leading up to the presidential election, the number of poll respondents who identified <b>Obama<\/b> as <b>a Muslim<\/b> was stable at about 12 percent.\nBy 2010, however, <b>it<\/b> had risen to 18 percent.\n<b>Republicans<\/b> and racial fears <b>Steve Chapman<\/b> After the 2008 presidential election, <b>it<\/b> was obvious that American pol<b>it<\/b>ics was entering a new era in which race would figure less than <b>it<\/b> had before.\nFor the first time in our history, <b>we<\/b> had a president who was not white, and it was bound to have a profound, positive impact.\nAfter <b>the 2008 presidential election<\/b>, <b>it<\/b> was obvious that <b>American pol<b>it<\/b>ics<\/b> was entering <b>a new era in which race would figure less than <b>it<\/b> had before<\/b>.\nFor the <b>first<\/b> time in <b><b>our<\/b> history<\/b>, <b>we<\/b> had <b>a president who was not white<\/b>, and it was bound to have <b>a profound, positive impact<\/b>.\n( Steve Chapman ) And according to Gallup, the release of <b>Obama<\/b>'s long-form birth certificate in April 2011 brought only to 47 percent, from 38 percent, the number of Americans who said that <b>Obama<\/b> was \"definitely\" born in the United States.\nAnot<b>he<\/b>r 18 percent said only that <b>he<\/b> was \"probably\" born in t<b>he<\/b> United States.\nEven after <b>the release of <b>the birth certificate<\/b><\/b>, 23 percent of <b>Republicans<\/b> continued to hold the view that <b>Obama<\/b> was born overseas.\n<b>These<\/b>, <b>I<\/b> suggest, are your <b>Trump<\/b> voters.\nRecent polling has in fact confirmed that <b>Trump<\/b>, a particularly prominent \"birther\" in 2010 and 2011, is tapping into this constituency.\nAccording to Public Policy Polling, 66 percent of <b>his<\/b> supporters believe <b>Obama<\/b> is Muslim and 61 percent think <b>he<\/b> was not born in t<b>he<\/b> United States.\nlRelated National politicsFor Mexicans, the <b>Donald Trump<\/b> candidacy is getting scarierSee all related\nFor the past five years, Trumpists have clocked in at about 20 percent of the electorate, if one tracks numbers of committed \"<b>Obama<\/b> is a Muslim-ists.\"\nThis makes <b>them<\/b> even more powerful than Britain's <b>UKIP<\/b>, which won 12.6 percent of the vote in May's parliamentary election.\n<b>These numbers<\/b> put the Trumpists on par with the National Front in <b>France<\/b>, which in March elections took 25 percent of <b>the vote<\/b> to the 32 percent that went to the center-right party of Nicholas Sarkozy.\nThe cr<b>it<\/b>ical difference bet<b>we<\/b>en <b><b>our<\/b><\/b> nationalist faction and the European ones is that <b>their<\/b> parliamentary systems register <b>them<\/b> as \"<b>parties<\/b>,\" whereas <b><b>our<\/b><\/b> two-party model makes <b>it<\/b> harder to see that what <b>we<\/b>'re confronting truly is the rise of a new party.\nProvided, <b>that<\/b> is, the Republicans don't sell <b>their<\/b> souls.\nIf <b>the Republicans<\/b> can hang on to the convictions that make <b>them<\/b> the party of Lincoln, <b>we<\/b> ought to see the party split.\nFor the good of the country, <b>we<\/b> should hope for <b>it<\/b>.\nTwo larger shifts in <b>our<\/b> sociopolitical landscape provide the framework necessary for understanding <b>the Trumpists<\/b>.\n<b>First<\/b>, there is the dramatic movement of <b>the United States<\/b> toward becoming a majority-minority country, where no ethnic group is in the majority.\n<b>We<\/b> have already crossed several Rubicons.\nIn 2011, new births were majority minority for the <b>first<\/b> time, and 2014 was the <b>first<\/b> year that minority students were in the majority at U.S. public schools.\nSeveral states are already <b>majority minority<\/b>.\ncComments @segesta The Republican candidates
