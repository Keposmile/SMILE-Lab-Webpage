Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) in New Hampshire, <b>the crucial first-in-the-nation primary state</b>.\n<b>Sanders</b> is also surging in the first-caucus state of <b>Iowa</b>  while continuing to rise in national polls of Democratic primary voters.\nA new CNN poll released this week also showed Clinton losing hypothetical match-ups with several Republican rivals, including former Florida Gov.
