Fordham Institute.Conservative activists, meanwhile, are frustrated that <b>they<\/b> haven't had more success.\n\"<b>I<\/b> would give up <b>my<\/b> right pinky if any of <b>these states<\/b> come up with standards that are substantially different from Common Core,\" said Erin Tuttle, an <b>I<\/b>ndiana homemaker who worked to repeal <b>the guidelines<\/b> only to see state officials replace <b>them<\/b> with a similar set of standards.At <b>the center of the controversy<\/b> is a long-standing tension within U.S. education.\nBusiness leaders say U.S. schools must become more consistent and rigorous in order to turn out graduates who can help the country compete in the global economy.\nInternational tests often show that U.S. students lag <b>their<\/b> peers in other industrialized countries.\nIn one 2012 math test, <b>they<\/b> ranked 27th among the 34 members of the <b>Organization for Economic Cooperation<\/b> and Development.Meanwhile, some parents worry that distant government and corporate interests are hijacking <b>schools<\/b>, which in the Un<b>it<\/b>ed States historically have been controlled at the local level.Although Common Core was developed by <b>Republican<\/b> and Democratic governors and state education officials, President Barack Obama also played a significant role by encouraging states to adopt <b>it<\/b> through a $4.4 billion grant program in 2009.\nCommon Core also has been caught up in a backlash against  standardized testing, which <b>critics<\/b> say stifles creativity and eat up too much classroom time.\nThese complaints predate Common Core by more than a decade, but <b>they<\/b> have been intensified as <b>schools<\/b> have revamped <b>their<\/b> tests to reflect the new standards.Half of all high school students in some districts in <b>Washington<\/b> state and Long Island, New York boycotted <b>Common Core-linked<\/b> standardized tests earlier this year.\nIn the coming school <b>year<\/b>, <b>nine<\/b> states will abandon tests that were developed to accompany Common Core in favor of <b>their<\/b> own assessments.\nExperts say <b>that<\/b> will make <b>it<\/b> more difficult to compare results across state lines.But even as the tests change, <b>the standards<\/b> are becoming deeply embedded in the nation's schools as <b>teachers<\/b> incorporate <b>them<\/b> into <b>their<\/b> lesson plans.\n\"<b>This<\/b> is the best shift in education <b><b>I<\/b><\/b>'ve seen since <b><b>I<\/b><\/b> started teaching 25 years ago,\" said Debra Troxell, a high-school geography teacher in Forsyth County, North Carolina.CR<b><b>I<\/b><\/b>T<b><b>I<\/b><\/b>CAL TH<b><b>I<\/b><\/b>NK<b><b>I<\/b><\/b>NGThe Common Core <b>standards<\/b> spell out what <b>students<\/b> should know at the end of the school year, but leave implementation to <b>teachers<\/b> and local officials.\nFor instance, sixth graders are expected to understand statistical concepts, while high schoolers are expected to write essays advancing an argument.Business groups and other backers say <b>the standards<\/b> better prepare high school graduates for the workforce.\nTeachers' unions back <b>the standards<\/b> as well, though <b>they<\/b> oppose linking test results to teachers' pay.\n<b>The standards<\/b> have a powerful advocate in Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates, who has spent more than $200 million to promote them.But <b>the standards<\/b> have baffled some parents who struggled to understand <b>their<\/b> children's homework, building on concerns about too much testing and lack of local control.South Carolina repealed Common Core in 2014.\nBut <b>officials<\/b> there have since adopted new standards that are 90 percent similar, according to a state oversight committee.\nIndiana's new standards also largely mirror Common Core.Oklahoma has reverted to <b>its<\/b> pre-Common Core standards while <b>officials<\/b> develop a replacement.\nEight other states are reexamining <b>the standards<\/b>, but there is little expectation of a major departure in policy.\n\"<b>It<\/b>'s sort of like putting a cow in a horse costume.\n<b>It<\/b>'s still <b>a cow<\/b>,\" said Emily Mitchell, <b>a kindergarten teacher in Smyrna, Tennessee.At this point, conservative activists are looking to the presidential race, rather than trying to roll back Common Core at the state level<\/b>, said <b>Adam Brandon, head of FreedomWorks, <b>a libertarian-leaning grassroots network<\/b><\/b>.\n\"Are <b>they<\/b> happy?\nNo,\" <b>Brandon<\/b> said.\n\"But the <b>Republican<\/b> nominee for president, chances are, is going to be very much against Common Core.\n\"<b>That<\/b> may not mean much, though.\nWhoever wins the election in 2016 is likely to have less sway over education than <b>Obama<\/b> because Congress is advancing legislation to prohibit the federal government from influencing state learning standards.By that point, <b>backers<\/b> say, Common Core will have already transformed <b>U.S. education<\/b>.\n\"We've seen Common Core hold pretty true across <b>the country<\/b>,\" said <b>Chris Minnich, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers<\/b>.\n(This
