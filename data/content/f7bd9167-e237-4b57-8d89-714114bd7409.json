Board of Education and Roe v. Wade, states \"persons born or naturalized in the <b><b>United States<\/b><\/b>, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the <b><b>United States<\/b><\/b> and of the state wherein <b>they<\/b> reside.\n<b>No state<\/b> shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of <b>the United States<\/b>; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within <b><b>its<\/b> jurisdiction<\/b> the equal protection of the laws.\"\nThe Administration's decision comes in response to Tuaua v. United States, a case in which five individuals born in American Samoa brought <b>claims<\/b> before a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit asking to be recognized as citizens rather than \"non-citizen nationals.\"\n<b>The panel<\/b> rejected the claims, and <b>the Obama decision<\/b> was made in response to the plaintiff's request for a rehearing before all the judges of the D.C. Circuit in July.\n<b>The D<\/b>,C, Circuit's decision regarding <b>the rehearing<\/b> is expected to be made over the next several months; if denied, plaintiffs might appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nResidents of <b>American <b>Samoa<\/b><\/b>, unlike the other territories, are not automatically granted citizenship and are instead classified as <b>nationals<\/b>.\nHowever, residents of <b>the other territories<\/b> should also be concerned over the <b>Obama<\/b> statement, says Neil Weare, <b>a civil rights attorney with <b>the We<\/b><\/b> The People Project, who has been working on the Tuaua case.\n\"Not recognizing c<b>it<\/b>izenship as <b>a fundamental right<\/b> means <b>it<\/b> can be repealed at any time,\" says <b>Weare<\/b>, who founded <b>the project<\/b> in 2013 in order to secure equal rights in all terr<b>it<\/b>ories and has been working w<b>it<\/b>h former Governor Charles Turnbull and Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett on projects in <b>the Virgin Islands<\/b>.\n<b><b>Weare<\/b>, who was raised in Guam<\/b>, says <b>his<\/b> ultimate goal is to achieve the right to vote for all territories, ideally by the upcoming presidential election.\nWhile <b><b>he<\/b><\/b> says <b><b>he<\/b><\/b> is optimistic about t<b><b>he<\/b><\/b> lawsuit, <b>Weare<\/b> says progress can only be made by taking a political stance and by unifying t<b><b>he<\/b><\/b> 4 million residents of Puerto Rico, <b>Virgin Islands<\/b>, <b>Guam<\/b>, Nort<b><b>he<\/b><\/b>rn Marianas and <b>American Samoa<\/b> to have one strong, collective voice.\n<b>Weare<\/b> says support has increased over the last four to eight years, especially among veterans.\n\"<b>Veterans<\/b> are involved in this because <b><b>they<\/b><\/b> fight for democracy, yet <b><b>they<\/b><\/b> can't enjoy <b>equal rights<\/b>,\" says <b>Weare<\/b>.\n<b>T<b>he<\/b> Virgin Islands<\/b> has a high rate of military service, and a military casualty rate three times hig<b>he<\/b>r than t<b>he<\/b> national, <b>he<\/b> says.\n\"<b>Veterans<\/b> continue to be disenfranchised.\"\nSemaj Johnson, <b>an attorney with K.A.
