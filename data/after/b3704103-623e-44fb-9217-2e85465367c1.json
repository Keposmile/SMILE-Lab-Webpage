Pillar \nIt now appears likely that even if the Republican-controlled Congress enacts a resolution of disapproval, any such resolution would not survive a presidential veto, which means the agreement <b>the Republican-controlled Congress<\/b> will come into force.\nIt also is possible that opponents will fail to get the 60 votes needed to get such a resolution through the Senate in the first place, in which case the outcome would be decided even earlier.\nIf <b>one that people with honestly expressed substantive differences had been addressing consistently in a sober and well-reasoned fashion<\/b> were one that people with honestly expressed substantive differences had been addressing consistently in a sober and well-reasoned fashion, one might expect that those on the losing side of <b>the outcome<\/b> would accept the result and turn <b>those on the losing side of that outcome<\/b> attention to how <b>those on the losing side of that outcome<\/b> can participate effectively in vigorous oversight of the agreement’s implementation.\nThere are indeed substantial opportunities for <b>the Republican-controlled Congress<\/b> to exercise such oversight.\nBut debate on <b>the matter<\/b> has had a deficit of sobriety and honesty.\nSome of the principal sources of oppos<b>the Obama administration<\/b>ion to <b>the agreement <b>the Obama administration<\/b>elf will come into force<\/b> have involved wanting <b>one that people w<b>the Obama administration<\/b>h honestly expressed substantive differences had been addressing consistently in a sober and well-reasoned

administration<\/b>.\n<b>the Congressional voting this month <b>the Congressional voting this month that is supposed to decide the matter<\/b> is supposed to decide the matter<\/b> and possible vetoing <b>the Congressional voting this month that is supposed to decide the matter<\/b> will take place later this month thus will mark only the end of one chapter in a continuing political contest.\nOpponents of <b>the agreement <b>the agreement <b>the agreement itself will come into force<\/b>self will come into force<\/b>self will come into force<\/b> will continue to try to subvert <b>the agreement <b>the agreement itself will come into force<\/b>self will come into force<\/b> even after <b>the agreement <b>the agreement itself will come into force<\/b>self will come into force<\/b> enters into force.\nThe partisan divide in sentiment on <b>one that people with honestly expressed substantive differences had been addressing consistently in a sober and well-reasoned fashion<\/b>, which, as Jim Lobe points out , has become increasingly sharp as reflected in opinion polls over the past year, will be one of the drivers of continued opposition.\n<b>one that people

States<\/b>elf will come into force<\/b> <b>the United States<\/b>elf will come into force<\/b>.\nGiven that <b>the Un<b>the United States<\/b>ed States<\/b> has no obligations under the agreement other than to end some of the punishment <b>the United States<\/b> has been inflicting in the form of economic sanctions, the agreement-killing strategy will entail slapping new sanctions on <b>the federal government sanction Iran<\/b> until Tehran is pressed passed the lim<b>the United States<\/b>s of <b>the United States<\/b>s tolerance for such accord-circumventing behavior.\nThe specific tactics may involve in effect restoring some of the nuclear-related sanctions that are due to be relaxed under <b>the agreement itself will come into force<\/b>, but under some new label such as terrorism or something having to do with other Iranian behavior.\nIdeas have already been advanced along these lines.\nOther creative ideas of <b>opponents<\/b> include having states rather than the federal government sanction Iran.\nAll such maneuvers will make <b>the federal government sanction <b>the federal government sanction Iran<\/b><\/b> difficult for <b>the federal government sanction

force<\/b>.\nU.S. opponents of <b>the agreement itself will come into force<\/b> will supplement <b>U.S. opponents of the agreement<\/b> sanctions maneuvers with continued efforts to play up any bit of Iranian behavior that is objectionable or can be portrayed as such.\nThe prominence that already has been given to the opponents’ contention that <b>a `` financial windfall '' that will fund increased `` nefarious '' Iranian activity in the region<\/b> will be a “financial windfall” that will fund increased “nefarious” <b>the federal government sanction Iran<\/b>ian activity in the region sets the stage, of course, for later drawing attention to just about anything that <b>the federal government sanction Iran<\/b> will actually or allegedly be doing in the Middle East that can be objected to.\nThe argument will be that any such behavior is a direct consequence of the “windfall,” regardless of how much <b>The argument<\/b> actually is a matter of Tehran reacting to events not of <b>The argument<\/b>s own making and has l<b>The argument<\/b>tle or nothing to do w<b>The argument<\/b>h Iranian finances.\nThis will all be in addition to making public issues out of anything that can be construed as an Iranian violation of the nuclear agreement <b>This<\/b> (which is different from the necessary process of sustained, careful, responsible oversight).\nWe have already gotten a preview of this sort of tactic with many such construals regarding Iranian observance of the Joint Plan of Action, the preliminary agreement reached in 2013, on which the actual Iranian record of compliance has been excellent.\nThe U.S. presidential election calendar has given diehard opponents of <b>the nuclear agreement itself<\/b> added incentive to inflict lethal sabotage on the agreement within the next 16 months.\nThe prospect of a Republican entering the White House in January 2017 may in this respect present more of a vulnerability than an opportunity for
